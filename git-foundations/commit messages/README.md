## Commit Message Best Practice
One recommended best practice when writing commit messages is to use a template file that contains commit guides you can use in writting your commits.

## Setting up a commit guide
- Create the commit text file using a text editor

    NOTE: Although it is not a requirement, you should save this text file in your home directory. 
    You also don't need to worry about the #. When it is rendered on git hub. the #'s are ignored.

- use the command: `git config --global commit.message` `[file location]` 
This command ensures that anytime you run `git commit` you use the template.
