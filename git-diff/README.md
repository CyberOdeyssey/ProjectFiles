# Exploring git diff

## Project Tasks
1. Initialize a new git repository and make an initial commit with two files.

2. Edit one file (donâ€™t stage), run git diff, and save the output.

3. Stage the file, run git diff and git diff --staged, and save both outputs.

4. Make two additional commits and record the commit history with git log --oneline.

5. Create a new branch, change a file, commit it, and compare it with main using git diff and git diff --name-only.
    
6. Compare two different commits with git diff <hash1> <hash2>.
    
7. Use at least three diff options (--name-status, --stat, --word-diff, or --ignore-space-change) and save the outputs.

8. (Bonus) Rename a file, make a small change, commit it, and capture the diff showing the rename.
